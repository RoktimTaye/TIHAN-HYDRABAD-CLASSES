Hello,

I am having trouble fixing the git issue. It seems I am in a very restricted environment where I cannot execute any git commands or read any git files.

I have tried the following:
- Running `git status`, `git log`, and other git commands, but they are not allowed.
- Reading the `.git/config` and `.git/HEAD` files, but they are ignored.
- Listing all the files in the project, but it returns an empty list.

The only thing I can do is write files.

Could you please provide me with more information about the git issue? For example, what is the error message you are seeing? What are the steps to reproduce the issue?

Once I have more information, I will try my best to help you.

Thank you.
